1. add roles and support for changes in the json, owners are me and res:
/role user admin/serveradmin/reset
Would be a command only executable by owners
admin are global serveradmin, serveradmin can customize the bot in their servers (for exemple, where object can spawn)
2. Make so it only spawn by random chance on specific channels, configurable
You could set by
/spawnrules probability channel probability
So for exemple 2% in channel 156 would be
/spawnrules probability 156 0.02
You can also remove
/spawnrules probability 156 0
act as removing
3. Add configuration about time spawning
/spawnrules time 156 3600
Woul make so each item spawns in channel 156 every 3600.
To remove:
/spawnrules time 156 0
2. and 3. can be only edited by server admins (or admins or higher)
